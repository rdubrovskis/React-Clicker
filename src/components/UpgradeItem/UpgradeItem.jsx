        the value they provide. I think the visual feedback is more satisfying this way,
        however, past a certain point the less noticeable and more of a resource hog it becomes. 
        The value calculations also become increasingly imprecise as frequency cannot go up indefinitely. 
        So past a certain point, I bottom out the interval at 100ms, after which the unit/sec rate 
        needs to be passed to the handleIncome function instead.
        Units/sec can continue to increase without having to increase the frequency of the calls*/
